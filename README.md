# NNTDice_Roller
d100 dice roller with support for modifiers for the Ninja Ninja Tactics community.

To add new modifiers, use the included GUI tool through the (Create) button, or modify the "Modifiers.txt" file according to the existing format. To modify existing modifiers, directly modify the "Modifiers.txt" file. A GUI tool for this may be included in later versions.

I encourage you to freely modify the "Modifiers.txt" file, as it may be inaccurate. If you see an inaccuracy, or a modifier has updated, feel free to open an issue or edit it yourself and launch a commit request.
